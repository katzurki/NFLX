# nflx-bookmarklets
A suite of bookmarklets to improve the Originator UX...one day.

Currently implemented are:

[Export SRT](https://katzurki.github.io/NFLX/ExportSRT.html), a bookmarklet to export the Target column of an Originator task in SRT. 

[Import SRT](https://katzurki.github.io/NFLX/ImportSRT.html), a Javascript tool that parses a given SRT file and writes its data into the clipboard in the form of Originator events that can be pasted in the Originator.

[FlixFont and Export MP4](https://katzurki.github.io/NFLX/ExportSRT.html), on the bottom of the page. FlixFont allows you to change the Originator font. Export MP4 lets you download the video for the current task.
